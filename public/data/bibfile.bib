		We consider affine switched systems as pertur- bations of linear ones, the equilibria playing the role of perturbation parameters. We study the stability properties of an affine switched system under arbitrary switching, assuming that the corresponding linear system is uniformly exponentially stable. It turns out that the affine system admits a minimal invariant set $\\Omega$, whose properties we investigate. In the two-dimensional bi-switched case when both subsystems have non-real eigenvalues we are able to characterize $\\Omega$ completely and to prove that all trajectories of the system converge to $\\Omega$. We also explore the behavior of minimal-time trajectories in $\\Omega$ by constructing optimal syntheses.

	Abstract = {Establishment and upholding of norms in a society is studied by constructing an agent-based model for the public goods game with punishments and limited information. The model includes players employing one of three strategies: defection, enforcement or cooperation. Game dynamics are introduced based on evolutionary game theory with poor performing players being more likely to revise their strategy.
	The model is studied numerically with the use of computer simulations. Questions addressed include the necessary conditions to attain a cooperative state and the impact of including cost-sharing institutional structures. An analytical study is also included, leading to the derivation of an approximate differential equation describing the dynamics of the game.
	It was found that for sufficiently severe punishments, enforcers are able to establish and sustain states of cooperation. This ability was observed to depend on the mobility of strategies and could be improved by including institutional structures.}

	Abstract = {Switched systems form a special class of hybrid dynamical systems, i.e. systems with both continuous and discrete dynamics. A switched system contains a family of continuous subsystems and a discrete variable that governs the switching between them. The problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability under arbitrary switching has re-ently been solved for the two-dimensional focused switched system $\\dot x = uAx + (1 − u)Bx$. We consider a generalization $\\dot x = uA(x − xc) + (1 − u)Bx$ where the equilibrium points of the two subsystems have been separated, a defocused system. Using geometrical arguments we show that whenever the focused system is asymptotically stable, a corresponding defocused system will contain a ‘smallest’ invariant set $\\Omega$. In the case when both the subsystems have non-real eigenvalues we are able to completely characterize $\\Omega$ and prove that all trajectories converge to $\\Omega$.
	We investigate topological properties of $\\Omega$ and classify the possible irregularities of $\\partial \\Omega$. We also build time-optimal syntheses inside $\\Omega$ which exhibit the behavior of minimal-time trajectories. Finally we briefly look at additional phenomena that occur when real eigenvalues are present in the subsystems.}

    Abstract = {We consider the problem of synthesizing hierarchical controllers for discrete-time switched affine systems subject to exogenous disturbances that guarantee that the trajectories of the system satisfy a high-level specification expressed as a linear temporal logic formula. Our method builds upon recent results on temporal logic planning and embedded controller synthesis. First, the control problem is lifted to a discrete level by constructing a finite transition system that abstracts the behavior of the underlying switched system. At the discrete level, we recast the problem as a two player temporal logic game by treating the environment driven switches as adversaries. The solution strategy for the game (i.e. the discrete plan) is then implemented at the continuous level by solving finite-horizon optimal control problems that establish reachability between discrete states and that compensate the effects of continuous disturbances. We also extend the earlier work by making efficient use of propositions in the temporal logic formula to drive the abstraction procedure and to facilitate the computation of continuous input at implementation time.
	An aircraft fuel system example is formulated; and solved using the proposed method. This sample problem demonstrates the applicability of the abstraction procedure and correct-by-construction controllers to regulate the fuel levels in multiple tanks during interesting operations like aerial refueling.}

	Abstract = {A crucial problem when measuring radiation from astronomical sources, such as pulsars, is timing. Because of geometrical and relativistic effects, the total distance traveled by a photon from source to detector will vary with time. This causes varying phase shifts in the photon times of arrival (TOAs) which makes a data analysis hard to perform. To solve this problem a time correction has to be applied to the TOAs. This report describes a method in which photon TOAs are converted to the inertial frame of the solar system mass center, which is a fixed point in the galaxy. The conversion require several transformations between time standards and different astronomical coordinate systems.
	
	PoBaTiC is a Python program which implements this method and is designed to be used for PoGOLite experiment data. With PoBaTiC, time corrections can be performed on a data file containing the GPS positions and TOAs for a set of observations. The accuracy of PoBaTiC is evaluated by performing the time correction on data gathered by the XMM-Newton satellite and comparing the result to corrections performed by XMM-Newton software. The tests show that the accuracy is at the level of a hundred nanoseconds and thus fulfills the requirements of PoGOLite.}

	Title = {Incremental Synthesis of Switching Protocols via Abstraction Refinement},
	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of synthesizing switching protocols that regulate the modes of a switched system in order to guarantee that the trajectories of the system satisfy certain high-level specifications. In particular, we develop a computational framework for incremental synthesis of switching protocols. Augmented finite transition systems are used as abstract representations of continuous dynamics. Inspired by counter-example guided abstraction refinement procedures for hybrid system verification, we start with a coarse abstraction and gradually refine it according to preorder relations on augmented finite transition systems. At each iteration, the proposed procedure can produce either a switching protocol that ensures the satisfaction of the specification, a certificate for nonexistence of such a protocol, or a refinement suggestion together with a partial solution to be used in the next iteration. Although the procedure is not guaranteed to terminate in general, we illustrate its practical applicability with two simple examples.}

	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {A plethora of driver convenience and safety automation systems are being introduced into production vehicles, such as electronic stability control, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, and obstacle avoidance.  Assuring the seamless and safe integration of each new automation function with existing control functions is a major challenge for vehicle manufacturers. This challenge is compounded by having different suppliers providing software modules for different control functionalities. In this paper, we report on our preliminary steps to address this problem through a fresh perspective combining formal methods, control theory, and correct-by-construction software synthesis. In particular, we begin the process of synthesizing the control software module for adaptive cruise control from formal specifications given in Linear Temporal Logic.  In the longer run, we will endow each interacting software module with an assume-guarantee specification stating under which environment assumptions the module is guaranteed to meet its specifications. These assume-guarantee specifications will then be used to formally prove correctness of the cyber-physical system obtained when the integrated modules interact with the physical dynamics.}
