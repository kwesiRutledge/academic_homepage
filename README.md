#academic_homepage

A simple homepage for academic use, based on AngularJS and Bootstrap.

## Features

## Installation

To set up the webpage on an existing server, just copy the content of `public` into your `public_html` folder and start editing the files in `html`.

For easy development/personalization, checkout the repo and do
